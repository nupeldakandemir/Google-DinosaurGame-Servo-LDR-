Playing Google Dinosaur Game with the help of LDR sensor and Servo Motor


This code is used to control the position of a servo motor based on the ambient light. The LDR sensor detects obstacles for the dinosaur and activates the servo motor. The servo motor is attached to the space key on the keyboard. Whenever a black obstacle is detected, the sensor triggers the servo motor, allowing the dinosaur to jump over the obstacles.
